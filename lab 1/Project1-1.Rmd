*Remember: I expect to see commentary either in the text, in the code with comments created using `#`, or (preferably) both! **Failing to do so may result in lost points!***

## Problem 1 (Verzani problem 1.1)
*Use R as you would a calculator to find numeric answers to the following:*

1. $1 + 2(3 + 4)$

```{r}
1 + (2*(3+4))
```

2. $4^3 + 3^{2 + 1}$

```{r}
(4^3) + 3^(2+1)
```

## Problem 2 (Verzani problem 1.4)
*Use R to compute the following:*

$$\frac{0.25 - 0.2}{\sqrt{0.2(1-0.2)/100}}$$

```{r}
(.25-.2)/(sqrt((.2*(1-.2))/100)) #using a bunch of separating parentheses just to be safe
```

## Problem 3 (Verzani problem 1.5)
*Assign the numbers 2 through 5 to different variables, then use the variables to multiply all the values.*

```{r}
a = 2
b = 3
c = 4
d = 5
a*b*c*d
```
